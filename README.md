# MMU GDC Game Jam 2025
## From May 23 to May 25th, I competed in my first ever game jam. My only experience in game making before this were a few retro games designed in Java with a simple interface and one C++ game which was only playable in the VS Code terminal. For this game however, I decided to try a new framework and library. I used Javascript and the Kaplay library to design and program the game. Kaplay is super beginner friendly and handles most of the game physics for the programmer. 

## Blue's Adventure
The theme of the game jam was "It's not about the destination."
Given my little experience in game development, I decided to develop an RPG game which incorporated many aspects of the games I played in my childhood. 
My main character, Blue, travels across several terrains in order to find ingredients to for his medicine. At the end of the journey, he recovers without needing the medicine. In reality, all he needed was some grass and sunlight. 

## Game Interface
The main game design is quite simple. All of the background images were outsourced and even Blue was orinally a shadow in a red cape jumping in piskelapp.com.
